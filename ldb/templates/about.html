    <h2>Architectural basics of our project</h2>
    <p>Quick information about our project. Here's how it works.</p>
    <ol id="getting_started_steps">
      <li class="getting_started">
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p> One of the main reasons why this database exists is to have a centralized location
            of information about <strong>liquor, beer, and wine</strong>.</p>
        <p> Our idea behind the project was for users to discover new and interesting drinks 
            that they might have never heard of or tried before. Our end goal was to provide 
            an easy to use website that would allow a user to query our database and discover 
            new drinks within our database.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="getting_started">
        <h3>What is this?</h3>
        <p> This website is geared towards users who are interested in expanding their
            knowledge about different styles of liquor, beer, and or wine. This project
            seeks to allow users to discover these new products along with other different
            items that could go along with it, such as food. </p>
        <p> The data we have within this project contains many different products that 
            the average user might not know about. Within our demo page, we show how exactly
            this website could work. We will give several examples with data to show the
            result of each question. </p>
      </li>
      <li class="getting_started">
        <h3>How was it built?</h3>
        <p> <strong><span class="code">paster quickstart</span></strong> -- This project was initially
            created using the paster quickstart script which is built into TurboGears. 
            This script allows us to generate the code required to begin the project.</p>
        <p> <strong><span class="code">data.py</span></strong> - The main work behind
            the database file is created in <strong>data.py</strong>. Each part of the
            database is known as a class in python. Each class has an 
            <span class="code">init</span> function that takes its attributes and 
            initializes each class. Each class is given a table name so that the project knows
            what to call the table when other parts of the project references it.
            Not only does each class have its own attributes, but many of our classes
            also require foreign keys.</p>
            <p> <strong><span class="code">websetup.py</span></strong> - Within this python file, 
            we enter in all of our setup data. When we compile our project, PasterScript goes
            through this file and uses <strong>DBSession</strong> within SQLAchemy to add
            each value into our tables. First, you add each attribute, using the definition we
            set up within data.py, and then we use DBSession to <i>add</i> the new created
            value into the specific table. DBSession uses <strong>transactions</strong>
            built into its framework so that if there are errors while generating the database,
            or if there are erros at run time while users are manipulating the database,
            DBSession will rollback the DB automatically.</p>
        <p>This is, of course, also exactly how the header and footer 
            templates are also displayed in their proper places, but we'll 
            cover that in the "master.html" template below.</p>
        <p>Oh, and in sidebar_top we've added a dynamic menu that shows the 
            link to this page at the top when you're at the "index" page, and 
            shows a link to the Home (index) page when you're here.  Study the 
            "sidebars.html" template to see how we used 
            <span class="code">py:choose</span> for that.</p>
        <p> <strong><span class="code">footer.html</span></strong> - The 
            "footer.html" block is simple, but also utilizes a special 
            "replace" method to set the current YEAR in the footer copyright 
            message. The code is: 
            <span class="code">&lt;span py:replace="now.strftime('%Y')"&gt;
                </span> and it uses the variable "now" that was passed 
            in with the dictionary of variables.  But because "now" is a 
            datetime object, we can use the Python 
            <span class="code">"strftime()"</span> method with the "replace" 
            call to say "Just Display The Year Here".  Simple, elegant; we 
            format the date display in the template (the View in the 
            Model/View/Controller architecture) rather than formatting it in 
            the Controller method and sending it to the template as a string 
            variable.</p>
        <p> <strong><span class="code">master.html</span></strong> - The 
            "master.html" template is called last, by design.  The "master.html" 
            template controls the overall design of the page we're looking at, 
            calling first the "header" py:def macro, then the putting everything 
            from this "about.html" template into the "content" div, and 
            then calling the "footer" macro at the end.  Thus the "master.html" 
            template provides the overall architecture for each page in this 
            site.</p>
        <p>But why then shouldn't we call it first?  Isn't it the most 
            important?  Perhaps, but that's precisely why we call it LAST. 
            The "master.html" template needs to know where to find everything 
            else, everything that it will use in py:def macros to build the
             page.  So that means we call the other templates first, and then 
             call "master.html". </p>
        <p>There's more to the "master.html" template... study it to see how 
           the &lt;title&gt; tags and static JS and CSS files are brought into 
           the page.  Templating with Genshi is a powerful tool and we've only 
           scratched the surface.  There are also a few little CSS tricks 
           hidden in these pages, like the use of a "clearingdiv" to make 
           sure that your footer stays below the sidebars and always looks 
           right.  That's not TG2 at work, just CSS.  You'll need all your 
           skills to build a fine web app, but TG2 will make the hard parts 
           easier so that you can concentrate more on good design and content 
           rather than struggling with mechanics.</p>

    <p>Good luck with TurboGears 2!</p>
